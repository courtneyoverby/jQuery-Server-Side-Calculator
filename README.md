# JQuery Server Side Calculator

This week, we were prompted to create a functioning calculator on the DOM.

## Description

This project acts as a calculator by allowing a client to enter a mathematical equation resulting in the answer to the equation. All previous equations entered will be stored on the DOM below the operators.
